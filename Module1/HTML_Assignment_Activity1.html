            <h1>Activity 1: Responsive Web Design</h1>
            <p>Use this website <a href="https://www.respinsinator.com/">www.responsinator.com</a> (Links to an external site.) to test the responsiveness of any website that you would like to test.
Post the URL to your test page from Responsinator.
Post your observations. <br> <br>
                Your results must include:
 <br>
1. Is the site you tested responsive to multiple formats? Does it perform well on all the devices? Or on some devices?
<br>
2. Why do you think the website is performing well on a particular device? So, does the responsive version include important aspects of the site? Does it present the content in an intuitive way? Similarly, if it performs poorly on a device - what are the issues in this representation? What does it get wrong.
<br>
3. What did you learn from this exercise about design?

Please feel free to use screenshots to explain your points.
