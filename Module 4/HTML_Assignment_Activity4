            <h1>Activity 4.2: Practicing CSS</h1>
            <p>Hi All,<br>
<br>
If you would like to practice how to make CSS work; here is an optional exercise for you.<br>
<br>
This will help you in understanding how to apply a CSS file to your HTML files.<br>
<br>
For this activity you will need atleast two HTML files (from a previous assignment or workshop will work fine or from your Assignment 2 content) and you will create one css file.<br>
<br>
Important to have ALL the files - HTML, images and the CSS file in one folder on your desktop.<br>
<br>
Start simple, by applying one rule in your css file â€“ for example<br>
<br>
1. you could write a rule about the page background color in a text file<br>
<br>
body {<br>
  background-color: yellow;<br>
}<br>
<br>
2. then save this text file as a styles.css<br>
<br>
3. Then add the following line in each HTML page<br> 
"link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"<br>
<br>
4. Now you have applied the style sheet to  all HTML files where you added that line above<br>
<br>
5. Now you can edit the styles.css file one rule at a time for as many rules as you need<br>
<br>
So, for your Assignment 2 website - my recommendation is to first make your HTML pages with the content that you want in these pages and then create an external style sheet and apply it to these pages.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
<br>
<br> <br>
                Your results must include:<br>
 <br>
1. Is the site you tested responsive to multiple formats? Does it perform well on all the devices? Or on some devices?<br>
<br>
2. Why do you think the website is performing well on a particular device? So, does the responsive version include important aspects of the site? Does it present the content in an intuitive way? Similarly, if it performs poorly on a device - what are the issues in this representation? What does it get wrong.<br>
<br>
3. What did you learn from this exercise about design?<br>
<br>
