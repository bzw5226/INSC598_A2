          <h2> How to be Successful </h2>
         <ul> <h3> Get Organized </h3>
          <ul> <li>Plan to spend 8 - 12 hours weekly on course readings, resources, interactions, and assignments.
<br><li>Plan to have consistent and reliable access to the internet.
<br><li>Note all the course graded assignments and exams on your personal calendar.
<br><li>Read the assigned reading material prior to beginning of each Module!
<br><li>View each of the videos assigned in the Modules and they will usually guide the following discussion prompt.
<br><li>Nail the early material! Every concept builds on the previous so it is imperative to get the early material down.
<br><li>Don't get behind! This summer course is not a "crammable" course. We will cover a lot of information in a short amount of time. It is impossible to learn this material right before an exam.
<br><li>Check your UT email and Canvas site every day. 

            </ul> 
           <h3> Get Help </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Email me immediately if you have any personal issues or questions.
<br> <li> Ask questions early and often! Take advantage of the Course Q&A Discussion Forum to seek feedback from other students.
<br> <li>Use Office Hours for help. If the suggested hours don't work for you, email me in advance and request a meeting.
<br><li>Contact OIT HelpDesk for assistance with Online@UT (Canvas), LiveOnline@UT (Zoom), Respondus LockDown Browser, and other technology issues in this class.
<br><li>Take advantage of the University Resources for students.
