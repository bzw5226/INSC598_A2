            <h1>Assignment 1: Website Critique</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>For this assignment, you will critique an existing website in terms of its effectiveness. The purpose of the assignment is to analyze various aspects of web design applied in a specific case. </p>
            <h2>Identifying a Site</h2>
            <p>You can choose any site you want, you might want to use a site that you are familiar with, so that you can answer questions for the site. </p>
            <h2>Aspects of Your Critique</h2>
            <p><strong>READ ME</strong> <br>
                The overall emphasis of your critique/analysis is the effectiveness of the design: content, format, navigation, etc. In critiquing/analyzing 
                the website, be sure to justify your assessment. More specifically, your critique should cover at least the following <strong>in paragraph format 
                (don't list your answers in bullet format).</strong> You should comment on each domain (e.g., "Users," "Purposes") but, you do <strong>not</strong> need to answer 
                each element listed as considerations under the domains. These are just to help you find things to critique. </p>
                <br>
                To aide you in focusing on each of the elements, I have developed a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13BazXGjpGuDL2R0CElpTHZt7v3Joiv1clHl4bLSfDCA/copy"> Google Doc in which you can collect your thoughts 
                (Links to an external site.).</a> Remember - the end product will convert this information into paragraph format.</p>
